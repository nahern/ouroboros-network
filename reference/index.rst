Ouroboros Network Docs
======================

The network documentation is a work in progress, we have various
documents in various stages:

-  `Technical report`_ which contains technical documentation of the
   network stack: mux layer, protocol descriptions and their state
   machines. Other parts of the document will be merged / reused in the
   ``Shelley Network Design`` document. Our aim is to join the two
   docuents into one consistent form. The technical parts are largely
   finished, though they need to be synced with recent changes in
   ``ouroboros-network`` repository.

-  `Ouroboros-Network Component Overview`_ - an overview of all the
   components maintained by the networking team.

-  `Data diffusion and peer discovery`_ a mind map of notions which was
   compiled to initially organise our knowledge (requires `xmind`_).
